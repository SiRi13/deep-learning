# Week 5 - INTRO TO TENSORFLOW

## Installation

Each directory has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.

### pip

To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

## Lesson 16 - Intro to TensorFlow
> Vincent Vanhoucke, Principal Scientist at Google Brain, introduces you to deep learning and Tensorflow, Google's deep learning framework.

### Lesson 16.27 - Lab: TensorFlow Neural Network
* Problem 1: Normalize the features
* Problem 2: Use TensorFlow operations to create features, labels, weight, and biases tensors
* Problem 3: Tune the learning rate, number of steps, and batch size for the best accuracy
